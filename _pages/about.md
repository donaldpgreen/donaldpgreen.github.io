Donald P. Green is J.W. Burgess Professor of Political Science at Columbia University, having moved there in 2011 after 22 years at Yale University. The author of five books and more than one hundred essays, Green studies a wide array of topics: voting behavior, partisanship, mass media, hate crime, and research methods. Much of his current work uses field experimentation to study the ways in which political campaigns mobilize and persuade voters.

He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2003 and was awarded the Heinz I. Eulau Award for the best article published in the American Political Science Review during 2009. In 2010, he helped found the Experimental Research section of the American Political Science Association and served as its first president. Donâ€™s hobbies include woodworking, running, and game design.
